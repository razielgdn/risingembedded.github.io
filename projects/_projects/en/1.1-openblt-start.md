### Introduction
OpenBLT is an open-source project. It can be used with multiple microcontrollers and protocols. This project can be ported to 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit architectures and brands (such as NxP, Texas Instruments, and ST Microsystems). It supports communication interfaces such as RS-232, CAN, USB, TCP/IP, and Modbus RTU with PC software for initiating and monitoring firmware updates. Additionally, add-on modules can be used for features like firmware encryption, improved checksum mechanisms, and master/slave gateways. Finally, it is open source, and you can choose between a GNU GPL license or a commercial license if needed.

### First steps
After publishing in the blog, I read the documentation and checked the latest software for the Nucleo STMF446RE board. I noticed that only Modbus is available in the demo.
   1. Download the sources from git or tarball, I used [tarball](https://www.feaser.com/openblt/doku.php?id=download) from SourceForge, in a future update, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/feaser/openblt) repo. 

   2. Configure sources in STM32Cube IDE
    - Open the File menu.

    - Import the boot folder. You can also import Prog demo. In this example, we will import both folders.

    - Compile the Boot folder to create the bootloader binaries.

    - After compiling, flash it to the board. When it is working, the green LED blinks.

   3. Test the software with a demo, I used the GPIO_IOToggle example from STM resources. 
    - You should make a couple of changes in the source to run the system without issues. The bootloader will be stored in the first part of flash memory. Following OpenBLT documentation, an offset should be defined for our application. In this example, we will change  **VECT_TAB_OFFSET** macro inside file *system_stm32f4xx.c* with the corresponding offset of "0x4000"

    - Once the srec file is done, you can flash the system with one of the tools provided by Feaser. I prefer Bootcommander because it runs on Linux. You can check Feaser documentation about their tools: [MicroBoot](https://www.feaser.com/openblt/doku.php?id=manual:microboot) or [BootCommander](https://www.feaser.com/openblt/doku.php?id=manual:bootcommander).
