## Starting the Implementation of OpenBlt Project

Today, I am beginning work on implementing the OpenBlt project. In my previous job, I implemented this project for an **STM34H53** platform. However, I will now port the project to a Nucleo 64 platform with an **STM32F446** microcontroller. 

I don't believe that it's an easy task, but as engineers, we thrive on challenges, and **'impossible' is what we do**.
